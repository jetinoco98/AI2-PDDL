A valid plan is generated with solver ENHSP -- 2020 version.

A few considerations:

- The plan uses ALL of the things the robot knows.
- Six (6) of the (8) nodes were selected for inspection.
- Data processing happens as soon as data is acquired.
- It is assumed that multiple instances of the same data is bundled before formatting.
- As clearly stated by the instruction, reporting happens "At the end of each inspection session". 
	- The sentence "after the robot have completed their tasks" was ambiguous because it did not specify
	if it refers to "ALL of their tasks", or "their tasks after EACH inspection".
	- Due to the mentioned above, updating and closing the BIM session happens after every inspection.
- A type ROBOT was used throughout the domain to be able to use the domain for more than 1 robot.

Optional:

- A multiple robot (2+) plan can work: 
	- It would make more sense if one robot does not contain all the tools.
	- However: The actions would be parallel, so reading a generating plan could be confusing.
